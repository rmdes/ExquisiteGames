# This is my Exquisite Repo

## I will start by writing non-sense into this repo

* and see where it leads me :)

## this is the begining of an amazing story

Once uppon a time there was a lost missing git branch swarming around the internet looking for its master
the branch was alone, cold, nobody was taking care of it, until a coder newbie stumbled uppon it and decided to check it out !
the newbie wasn't even aware of it, but this was the begining of an amazing adventure

Christian <p> There is no non-sense that doesn't make sense <p>
